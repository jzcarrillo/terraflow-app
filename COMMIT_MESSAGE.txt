refactor: Implement single universal Docker image across all environments

BREAKING CHANGE: Frontend now uses runtime configuration instead of build-time variables

Changes:
- Frontend: Removed NEXT_PUBLIC build args, added /api/config runtime endpoint
- Helm: Changed to runtime env vars (API_URL, DASHBOARD_URL, NODE_ENV)
- Pipeline: Updated to build single universal image for all environments
- Added test script to verify single image works across environments

Benefits:
- Build once, deploy everywhere (immutable artifacts)
- Same tested image deployed to QA, UAT, and PROD
- Faster deployments (no rebuild per environment)
- Follows 12-Factor App best practices

Files changed:
- frontend/Dockerfile
- frontend/src/app/api/config/route.js (new)
- frontend/src/utils/config.js
- helm/templates/frontend-deployment.yaml
- helm/values-qa.yaml
- helm/values-uat.yaml
- helm/values-prod.yaml
- azure-pipelines-simple.yml
- scripts/test-single-image.sh (new)
- scripts/deploy-uat-auto.sh (new)

Tested:
✅ Single image verification across QA and UAT
✅ Runtime config API working
✅ E2E tests passing (registration, login, navigation)
